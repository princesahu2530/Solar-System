# 3D Solar System Simulation

A 3D simulation of our solar system built with Three.js. This project demonstrates the use of 3D rendering, animation, and user interaction in a web browser.

## Features

- Realistic 3D representation of the Sun and all 8 planets
- Planet orbits and rotations with adjustable speeds
- Interactive controls for each planet's orbital speed
- Background stars for immersion
- Tooltips showing information when hovering over planets
- Pause/Resume animation functionality
- Dark/Light mode toggle
- Camera focus on planets when clicked
- Background music and sound effects
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Real-time date-based planet positions
- Navigation controls for camera movement
- Planet moons with proper orbits
- Saturn's rings

## How to Run

you can use any local development server like Live Server in VS Code.

## Controls

- **Planet Speed Sliders**: Adjust the orbital speed of each planet
- **Pause/Resume Button**: Stop or continue the animation
- **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Switch between dark and light themes
- **Sound Toggle**: Turn background music on/off
- **Mouse Hover**: Show information about planets
- **Click on Planet**: Focus camera on the selected planet
- **Double Click**: Reset camera to original position
- **Mouse Drag**: Rotate the camera around the scene
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D rendering
- JavaScript for animation and interaction
- HTML/CSS for layout and styling

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file
- `styles.css`: CSS styles for the UI
- `js/main.js`: Main application logic
- `js/planets.js`: Planet data and properties
- `js/controls.js`: UI controls and interaction
- `js/utils.js`: Utility functions
